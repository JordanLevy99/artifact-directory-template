Title:
<Explaining Image Captioning Models Through Attention Maps, Image
Perturbations, and Object Importance Maps>

Abstract:
<Image captioning models are complex because they
work on object detection as well as caption generation.
When these models fail it is hard to understand where
and why they fail. To explain how an image captioning
model works, we use attention maps to visualize the
relationships between generated words and objects in
an image. Moreover, we utilize an image perturbation
model to alter regions of images to see how the cap-
tions change and to test the robustness of our model
by measuring the similarity between captions gener-
ated before and after the altering of the image.>
